# 🧩 String Analyzer Service — Backend Wizards Stage 1

A RESTful API service that analyzes strings, computes their properties, and supports both structured and natural-language filtering.

---

## 🚀 Overview

For each analyzed string, the service computes and stores:

| Property | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `length` | Number of characters in the string |
| `is_palindrome` | True if the string reads the same forwards and backwards (case-insensitive) |
| `unique_characters` | Count of distinct characters |
| `word_count` | Number of words separated by whitespace |
| `sha256_hash` | Unique SHA-256 hash of the string |
| `character_frequency_map` | Dictionary mapping each character to its occurrence count |

All strings are stored in memory (dictionary) for this stage, but the structure supports database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL) for persistence.
